1.Use Add Stage to add your stage's script Into 
the stage.
2.Use Set Visibility to set If it's visible or not.
3.Use Set Character XY to place the characters in the 
proper stage places.
I recommend stacking all 3 of these events together, 
use multiple "Set Visibility" Events too.
You could add a variable that checks if your stage Is
visible and changes character XY if you're actually good at lua.
